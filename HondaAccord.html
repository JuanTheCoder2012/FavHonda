    <h1>2021 Honda Accord 2.0T Sport Review: My Number One Choice!</h1>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9odPlLKBlGg?si=TcO4fTvJykEbZK50" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>Few vehicles have acquired as many accolades as the Honda Accord, and there’s a very good reason for that. Now 45 years in the making, 
        Honda has continually refined the formula to its mid-size sedan resulting in an exceptionally polished experience. DriveBreakFixRepeat’s earlier
         review of the Honda Accord Hybrid proved as much, declaring it as “best in class.”</p> 
    
    <p>Though, with three distinct powertrains to choose from, it’s time to swing from the eco-minded hybrid to the what Honda claims to be the “enthusiast’s choice,” 
         the Accord 2.0T Sport, a vehicle that goes head to head with another enthusiast-built mid-sizer, the Toyota Camry TRD."</p>

    <p>Both models represent the least expensive way to get their respective go-fast engines. The Camry has more peak power from its gutsy 3.5-liter V6 engine,
         but the Honda derives more down low grunt from its 2.0-liter turbo-four. Applying all 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque to the front wheels through the 10-speed
          automatic transmission makes the Accord is feisty off the line, clicking off the 0-60 mph sprint in about five-and-a-half seconds.</p>

    <p>While the Accord is more than ready to take on your neighbor’s Camry in the occasional stop light drag race, it’s really when the road 
        gets twisty that the Accord begins to shine. The Sport model may not have the excellent adaptive dampers fitted to more expensive Touring trim Accord, 
        nor does it have the hardcore autocross-inspired suspension upgrades that Toyota fits to a Camry TRD, but it does have flow. </p>
