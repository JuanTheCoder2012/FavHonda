# FavHonda
This project is another project I want to build, I want to add my favorite cars only Hondas. 


9/28/2023 1152pm: Managed to fix a couple of things on the index and want to do more, I will find out on how to add a slideshow to make it look better.
managed to link the submit button and the submitted.html and fixed the submitted page will be adding more to it.

<!-- will be adding a button for the official honda dealership and see if I want to put a button for the new event in JAPAN. -->

had to move everything to another .HTML file: Cause of the issue? added a video file that was over 100MB
NOTE: Do not use video file that is over 100MB can not commit to GitHub.
video size is too big. instead go to youtube copy Embedded code to line of code. It will commit faster,
as well as look better on Browser.
